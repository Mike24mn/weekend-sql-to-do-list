## Description

This project is a full-stack CRUD application for managing a to-do list. Users can create, complete, and delete to-do items, with changes reflected in both the database and the user interface. The app demonstrates the integration of client-side, server-side, and database components to achieve a cohesive and functional to-do list experience!!!

STEPS:

1. CREATE A DATABASE TITLED "weekend-to-do-app"

2. CREATE A TABLE WITHIN THE DATABASE WITH THE SQL COMMANDS LOCATED WITHIN 'database.sql"

3. RUN 'npm install' to ensure modules are available

4. RUN "npm start" to get the server started.

5. NAVIGATE TO THE localhost port listed after you initilized the server via "npm start"

For example, if the server was started on port 5001, navigate to that specific localhost port in your browser.

i.e,

http://localhost:5001/

6. ENJOY THE TO DO LIST CHECKER! TRY ADDING A NEW TO DO VIA ADD NEW ITEM, OR DELETING CURRENT ITEMS VIA THE DELETE BUTTON, ALSO MARKING ITEMS AS COMPLETED IS DONE THROUGH CLICKING THE GOAL COMPLETE BUTTON.
